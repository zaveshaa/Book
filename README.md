| "Задачи с параметрами" | Михаил Якир и Павел Исидорович Горнштейн   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Everything is explained very clearly.The tasks are quite interesting. But the only thing is the format of the book and its binding, it’s scary to open it so as not to tear it.But it did not affect the content) |
| "Линейная алгебра и геометрия" | А.И.Кострыкин и Ю.И.Манин | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Well, as always: it’s explained quite clearly. Large font, nice cover. Quite a lot of formulas |
